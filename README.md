# Projet 

This project is made with Vue3, Nuxt3 and typescript and CVA and without any UI libraries.
For the favourite feature I used Pinia with pinia-plugin-persistedstate to keep our store values in the localStorage.
CVA is present just to showcase what we can do with it in a real design system, it can manage all the different variants of our components.
I used fontAwesome just for the icons.

In the compoments/UiKit folder you can find all the components that I used and in the pages folder the two page used for the project.
